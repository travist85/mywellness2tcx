    <h1>How to Export Workouts from Technogym MyWellness</h1>
    <p>
      This guide explains how to get your workout data out of MyWellness so you can convert it to TCX or FIT.
      It is written for users with no technical background.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outcome: you will have a ZIP export that can be uploaded directly into the converter.
    </p>

    <h2>What you can export</h2>
    <p>
      In MyWellness, machine sessions are typically stored in files named <code>indooractivities-*.json</code> inside your export ZIP.
      The converter reads these files directly.
    </p>

    <h2>Export steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Sign in to your MyWellness account on desktop.</li>
      <li>Open account settings and look for data/privacy export options.</li>
      <li>Request and download your archive when it is ready.</li>
      <li>Save the ZIP file without changing its contents.</li>
      <li>Open the converter and use <b>Upload ZIP</b>.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Quick checks before upload</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not extract and re-zip unless necessary.</li>
      <li>Make sure the ZIP contains at least one file named <code>indooractivities-*.json</code>.</li>
      <li>If your export is old, request a fresh one and retry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If ZIP export is missing or incomplete</h2>
    <p>
      Use the converter's <b>Paste JSON</b> mode for a single workout. You can copy a workout response from your browser dev tools.
